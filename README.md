# Embedding Atlas into a Spring Boot 2 App

This is just a demonstration of how you can embed a full running Atlas server inside a Spring Boot 2 application. The demo includes a simple static index.html file that has a series of `<img>` tags that generate charts from the embedded Atlas.

For demonstration alone, it contains a simulation of semi-frequent outbound HTTP client requests.

Enjoy!
